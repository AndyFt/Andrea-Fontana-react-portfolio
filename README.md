## Description

This is the third version of my portfolio, now created with JavaScript and React, with the projects I've done so far as a Front-End Developer student. It has improved a lot since the first one. I'll keep it up to date with new projects.

![The webpage of my portfolio has 4 pages - Home, About, Projects and Contact - includes a navigation bar, a hero banner image and a footer with links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and Email](https://github.com/AndyFt/Andrea-Fontana-react-portfolio/blob/main/src/assets/images/HomeSS.png)
